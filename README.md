# Color Detection for Color Blindness Analysis

In this task, we delve into the analysis of a dataset aimed at detecting colors in images using Python. 
The focus is on color detection for individuals with color blindness (ColorBlind).
 We explore the RGB dataset for color representation and highlight the three primary colors relevant to color blindness. 

## Key Components

1. **Dataset Analysis:**
   - Understanding and utilization of the RGB dataset for color representation.
   - Identification of the three main colors affecting individuals with color blindness.

2. **Comparison:**
   - Visual representation comparing normal color vision with different types of color blindness (ColorBlindness).

3. **Workflow Diagram:**
   - Presentation of the workflow diagram outlining the steps involved in the color detection task.

4. **Block Diagram:**
   - Illustration of the block diagram representing the algorithm's architecture.

## Algorithm Implementation

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:**
  - OpenCV for image processing
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - Numpy for numerical operations

## Development Environment

The algorithm is implemented using the Visual Studio Code program, providing a convenient interface for code development and result visualization.

## Getting Started

To explore the color detection analysis:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Use your preferred Python environment to run the algorithm.
