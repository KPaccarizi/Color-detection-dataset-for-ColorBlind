# Color Detection for Color Blindness Analysis

In this task, we delve into the analysis of a dataset aimed at detecting colors in images using Python. 
The focus is on color detection for individuals with color blindness (ColorBlind).
 We explore the RGB dataset for color representation and highlight the three primary colors relevant to color blindness. 

## Key Components

1. **Dataset Analysis:**
   - Understanding and utilization of the RGB dataset for color representation.
   - Identification of the three main colors affecting individuals with color blindness.

2. **Comparison:**
   - Visual representation comparing normal color vision with different types of color blindness (ColorBlindness).
